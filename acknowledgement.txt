acknowledgement
 

I would like to express my special thanks of gratitude to our teacher mrs. sreerekha
as well as our principal mrs.prathiba without whose support , this project would have been not possible
 who gave me the golden opportunity to do
 this wonderful project on the topic tuckshop management, which also helped me in doing
 a lot of Research and i came to know about so many new things I am really thankful to them.
Secondly i would also like to thank our parents and friends who helped me a lot in finalizing
 this project within the limited time frame.
